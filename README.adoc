= I18n Tool
Tool scanning translation bundles in a GitHub repository. A UI editor allows to find (missing) translations and fill them.


== What is It?
* Web App scanning translation files of a GitHub repository
* UI for editing translations files
* Commit & push modified translations


== Why?

* No existing solution on the market
* Investigating up-to-date technologies: 
    ** Java 11+
    ** Spring 5 & Boot 2
    ** Angular 8:
        *** How to do testing with: Karma, Jasmine and Protractor
        *** How to structure code? and tests?
        *** i18n in Angular
        *** Websocket
    ** How to create a Spring Docker App
    ** Java integration with Git(Hub)
    ** How to develop a webhook?
    ** How to create an OAuth2 client with Spring?
    ** How to have a continuous integration and deployment?
        * Travis-CI.com
    ** Remaining:
        *** Junit 5
        *** Reactive programming on backend side
* Start a project from scratch


== Presentation

The startup page is the login page. Every user must be authenticated.
The external user must be part of the organization.

An administrator user "_admin_" is automatically created.
Its password can be either auto-generated (and printed out on the console),
or specified with the environment variable _DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD_.

User can also use their GitHub account to log on the application. Only users allowed to access to the
repository are allowed.

Authenticating with "auth-key" is mainly used for automated testing.
The associated user must be able to access the current repository.

The default section is "translations" allowing to search and translate keys.
By default, the searcher looks for missing translations in users' languages.

It's also possible to search for all translations, translations that have been updated
by the current user (or not only by himself). A workspace is the current
edition of a Git Branch. By default, the "master" workspace is used.

Once all translations of a workspace have been filled, it
can be reviewed. A pull-request is generated with all the changes.

Once the pull-request and the associated branch is closed/merged, the workspace
is deleted. A new workspace based on the Git branch can be created later on.

== Environment Setup
=== Travis Configuration

The following environment variables are needed by this Travis-CI build:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY=   **
* AWS_SECRET_KEY=**
* AWS_BUCKET_NAME=**
* DOCKER_PASSWORD=**
* DOCKER_USERNAME=**
* E2E_SERVER_PORT=8080
* E2E_GIT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN=**

There are 4 jobs:

. Build of front and back including unit tests. The docker image is build as a candidate.
. E2E tests. The application is launched in the building container.
. The docker image is deployed in the image registry. The candidate image is tagged as the final one.
. The application is deployed

=== Amazon EB Configuration

The following environment variables must be setup on Amazon Elastic Bean Stalk:

* SERVER_PORT
* DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION
* GIT_HUB_OAUTH_CLIENT
* GIT_HUB_OAUTH_SECRET
* GIT_HUB_REPO_USER_NAME
* GIT_HUB_REPO_NAME
* GIT_HUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
* DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD (optional)

The EB environment must use an IAM role allowing to attach an EC2 volume.
Either modify the existing role _aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-service-role_, or create a dedicated role. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_ec2_volumes-instance.html[AWS DOcumentation]
